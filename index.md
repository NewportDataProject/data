# The Newport Data Project Data Repository

This is the location of our future repository for open datasets. The idea is to leverage the GitHub's support for Jekyll to create an
easy-to-use web interface for browsing and accessing the data. Beyond the technical aspects of creating the repository, we'll need to 
come through ways to handle data licensing.
